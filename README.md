# Generating Documentation for Your Codebase

This guide will help you generate structured documentation for your project using LLMs (like Claude) and the Sphinx library.

## How Does Sphinx Work?

Sphinx compiles all the docstrings from the files and folders you specify, generating a well-structured, organized documentation. To automate the process of writing docstrings, we can leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) like Claude, GPT, etc.

Once the docstrings are ready, Sphinx will handle the rest, creating documentation from the structured content.

## Step 1: Docstring Generation Using LLMs

### **Docstring Generator**

The **Docstring Generator** automates the creation of docstrings for your code. Pass the files you want to document to the generator, and it will output well-structured docstrings for your functions, classes, and modules.

For this example, we are using **Claude** for docstring generation, but feel free to use any LLM model of your choice.

## Step 2: Setting Up Sphinx

### Step 2.1: Ensure `__init__.py` Files Are Present

Make sure that every folder you want to include in the documentation has an `__init__.py` file. This is required for Sphinx to recognize and document the modules.

### Step 2.2: Install and Configure Sphinx

#### Instructions:

````bash
# Step 1: Create a directory for your documentation
mkdir docs

# Step 2: Navigate into the docs directory
cd docs

# Step 3: Install Sphinx and additional dependencies
pip install sphinx rinohtype sphinx-rtd-theme sphinxcontrib-httpdomain

# Step 4: Initialize the Sphinx configuration
sphinx-quickstart

# Step 5: Go back to the project root
cd ..

# Step 6: Generate .rst files for each module (folders containing __init__.py files)
sphinx-apidoc -o docs .

# Ensure each folder you want to document has an __init__.py file.

3. Editing Documentation Files

   1. Edit the modules.rst file:
      Add the module to index.rst to include it in the documentation index.
   2. Customize .rst files:
      Modify the titles and sections in the .rst files to structure the documentation to your liking.

4. Configuring conf.py
   1. Update the conf.py file in the docs directory by adding the necessary extensions:

```bash
# Ensure the system path is set up correctly
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath(".."))

# Add these extensions to the list in conf.py
extensions = [
    "sphinx.ext.todo",
    "sphinx.ext.viewcode",
    "sphinx.ext.autodoc",
]
````

5. Building the Documentation
   Once everything is set up, build the HTML documentation by running the following command:

```bash
# Navigate into the docs directory
cd docs

# Build the HTML documentation
./make.bat html    # On Windows
# make html         # On Linux/Mac

```

After this step, your documentation will be generated and available in the docs/\_build/html/ directory.
Open index.html page and check.

## Auto Documentation Generator for a Python Codebase

### Overview

The goal of this project is to automatically generate documentation for a large Python codebase consisting of multiple Flask services. The process involves analyzing the codebase, generating docstrings for functions, and storing these docstrings along with their embeddings in a vector database. The process will be carried out in a hierarchical manner, starting from the leaf functions (those that do not call other functions) and moving up to the root API endpoints.

### Detailed Workflow

1. **Codebase Analysis**:

   - **Objective**: Traverse through each file in the codebase, identify functions, and understand their call hierarchy.
   - **Implementation**:
     1. Parse each Python file to extract functions and their respective docstrings (if any).
     2. Construct a call graph where nodes represent functions and edges represent function calls.
     3. Identify leaf functions (functions that do not call any other functions).

2. **Leaf Function Documentation**:

   - **Objective**: Generate and insert docstrings for leaf functions.
   - **Implementation**:
     1. For each leaf function, generate a docstring using a predefined template or a documentation generation tool.
     2. Insert the generated docstring into the function if it does not already exist.
     3. Generate embeddings for the docstring.
     4. Create a unique identifier for each function based on its name and the file in which it is defined.
     5. Store the function ID, embeddings, and docstring in a vector database.

3. **Intermediate and Parent Function Documentation**:

   - **Objective**: Generate and insert docstrings for functions that call other functions.
   - **Implementation**:
     1. Once all leaf functions are documented, move up the call hierarchy to their parent functions.
     2. For each parent function:
        - Check if a docstring already exists in the database. If so, skip to the next function.
        - If not, generate a docstring that incorporates context from its child functions.
        - Generate embeddings for the docstring.
        - Create a unique identifier and store the function ID, embeddings, and docstring in the vector database.

4. **API Endpoint Documentation**:
   - **Objective**: Generate comprehensive documentation for each API endpoint.
   - **Implementation**:
     1. Once all functions in the codebase are documented, generate documentation for each API endpoint.
     2. Combine the docstrings of functions involved in the endpoint to create a cohesive API documentation.
     3. Store the API documentation in a suitable format (e.g., Markdown, HTML).

### Optimization and Improvements

1. **Parallel Processing**:

   - To speed up the process, consider parallelizing the parsing and docstring generation steps.
   - Use multiprocessing or distributed computing frameworks to handle large codebases efficiently.

2. **Incremental Updates**:

   - Implement a mechanism to detect changes in the codebase and update documentation incrementally.
   - Use file modification timestamps or version control diffs to identify changed files/functions.

3. **Enhanced Docstring Generation**:

   - Utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to generate more descriptive and informative docstrings.
   - Integrate with models like GPT to generate human-like documentation.

4. **Vector Database Optimization**:
   - Ensure efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings by choosing an optimized vector database.
   - Implement indexing and search optimizations to speed up docstring lookups.

### Implementation Guide

1. **Setup the Environment**:

   - Install necessary libraries: `ast`, `networkx` for graph construction, `transformers` for embeddings, and a vector database like `Pinecone` or `Faiss`.
   - Setup a project structure to organize scripts and data.

2. **Parse the Codebase**:

   - Write a script to traverse the directory and parse Python files using the `ast` module.
   - Extract functions and construct the call graph using `networkx`.

3. **Generate and Insert Docstrings**:

   - Implement a function to generate docstrings using a template or NLP model.
   - Write the docstrings back into the function definitions using `ast` or directly modifying the source code.

4. **Store Embeddings and Metadata**:

   - Generate embeddings for each docstring using a pre-trained model from `transformers`.
   - Store the function ID, embeddings, and docstring in the chosen vector database.

5. **Documentation Generation**:

   - Traverse the call graph to generate docstrings for intermediate and parent functions.
   - Combine function docstrings to create comprehensive API documentation.
   - Export the documentation in the desired format.

6. **Automation and CI/CD**:
   - Setup a CI/CD pipeline to automate the documentation generation process.
   - Trigger the pipeline on codebase changes to ensure documentation is always up-to-date.
